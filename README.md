# New portfolio website

So this is going to be my main portfolio website which i will host on fajfar.tech. Atm i am still building it, but it will probably take me sometime, since i am developing the twitch project as well. Bellow is a changelog of changes.

DAY 13.04.2018

> Adding the readme file to the repository also fixed email issue which i had, the problem was any commit i did to any of my projects didn't count in my stats. Adding some more place holder images later on for portfolio. Probably working on it more tommorrow. 

DAY 14.04.2018

> Just converted everything to scsss, i like it a lot more then just plain css. Added a new color pallet, still not decided on that yet. Also minor JS bug fixes.

DAY 15.04.2018

> Added another item to the portfolio section styling isn't done yet. Added the contacts section and styled it a bit, also added the resources section where i will list all the sources. Currently the website is not responisive so that would be the work for the future. 

DAY 22.04.2018

> After working on some tutorials on CSS and SCSS i decided to completely redo the website. The theme i am going for is retro, 80s style - Glam rock, neon etc. Added the VHS effect on text on the landing section of the website, neon effect on h1 and some button effects. Also background image changed, for now i am using a neon street picture. 

DAY 23.04.2018

> Fixes for positions of text, headings etc. Changed the text so it now has a VHS effect. Also added the navigation for the website. So far not finished yet, hopefuly i will be done by the end of this week. So far i like it.
