# New portfolio website

So this is going to be my main portfolio website which i will host on fajfar.tech. Atm i am still building it, but it will probably take me sometime, since i am developing the twitch project as well. Bellow is a changelog of changes.

DAY 13.04.2018

> Adding the readme file to the repository also fixed email issue which i had, the problem was any commit i did to any of my projects didn't count in my stats. Adding some more place holder images later on for portfolio. Probably working on it more tommorrow.
