# New portfolio website

So this is going to be my main portfolio website which i will host on fajfar.tech. Atm i am still building it, but it will probably take me sometime, since i am developing the twitch project as well. Bellow is a changelog of changes.

DAY 13.04.2018

> Adding the readme file to the repository also fixed email issue which i had, the problem was any commit i did to any of my projects didn't count in my stats. Adding some more place holder images later on for portfolio. Probably working on it more tommorrow. 

DAY 14.04.2018

> Just converted everything to scsss, i like it a lot more then just plain css. Added a new color pallet, still not decided on that yet. Also minor JS bug fixes.

DAY 15.04.2018

> Added another item to the portfolio section styling isn't done yet. Added the contacts section and styled it a bit, also added the resources section where i will list all the sources. Currently the website is not responisive so that would be the work for the future.
